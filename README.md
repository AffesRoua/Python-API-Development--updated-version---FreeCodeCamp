# API Development with Python updated version (Based on FreeCodeCamp Tutorial)

I followed the first 11 hours of the [FreeCodeCamp API development tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=41400s) to learn about building APIs with Python. This repository contains my work, which may differ slightly from the tutorial.

Some functions used in the tutorial no longer exist, so I adapted parts of the code while maintaining the original function signatures and outputs. If you're looking for alternative approaches or inspiration beyond the tutorial, you can explore my implementations here.

## Technologies Used

### Software:
- **Postman** - API testing and development tool.
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database management system.

### Libraries:
- **FastAPI** - Web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **SQLAlchemy** - SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
- **Alembic** - Lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy.

### Techniques:
- **CRUD Operations** - Implementation of Create, Read, Update, Delete operations.
